# mini-redis

This project implements a mini version of [Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis).

FYI, Redis is no longer open source since [03.2024](https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/13157).

However, its source code is still valuable for learning.
After understanding it, you might want to fork and make it great and free again.
